
===================
Problem in the doc
==================

No way to track the current buffer if the user switches it.

--> will poll the socket continusly for getCursor but not a pretty solution.

====

No way to send keys through the netbean protocol.

===

editBuffer is rather counter-intuitive with notification about bufId 0

===

No way of knowing current short filename and long filename of the buffer.

====

mapping does not seem to apply to --remote-send

===

:nbkey generates hotkey messages even if there are no hotkey mapping.
